# FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS
In this task, the goal is to examine the banking patterns of clients for 'The Big Bank'. The aim is to extract useful insights regarding customer account behavior, such as determining the identities of clients living in a particular area, the overall number of accounts, the total checking account balance, the balance of accounts connected with specific regions and customers, and the branch with the highest mean account balance, among other things.

The financial analyst created SQL queries for this challenge to aid in the extraction of significant information on customer banking behavior. Every query serves a distinct purpose in examining the customers and their accounts.
